# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains the code and output for Morgan Watson's final project in the Fall 2024 BMIN 503/EPID 6000 course. 

The research question this project sought to answer was how experiencing arrest or incarceration in childhood affects health in adulthood. This question was addressed using public-use longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Individuals who were arrested or incarcerated before the age of 18 were considered to have experienced the exposure. The outcomes of interest included physical health (general self-reported health and BMI), mental health (counseling, depressive symptoms, and suicidality), and health behaviors (cigarette use, alcohol use, and marijuana use).

The Quarto document called final_project.qmd includes all necessary code for the cleaning and analysis of the Add Health data. The specific Add Health Wave data are available for download at the following site: https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/addhealth.

The HTML document called final_project.html includes all code and output associated with the research question.

The following files include draft versions of the final project:
  final_project_template.qmd
  final_project_analysis.qmd
